            <p class="lead">Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Ross Burton, and I'm a tech enthusiast, eager to apply my skills to the world of healthcare and laboratory medicine.
            On this page you will find links to all the projects and ideas I have contributed too. I also share my insights and experience with online education and how I taught myself programming, data science, and
            web development.</p>
            <p class="lead"><strong>So why data science? and why the web?</strong></p>
            <p class="lead">Healthcare, as with many industries, is changing. With a growing population, and new challenges of both financial and political origin, it is vital that we leverage technology
            to help our healthcare systems survive and grow. Having originally trained in laboratory medicine (specificially infectious disease diagnostics) I have experienced first hand the growing pressures on our healthcare systems.
            We in healthcare sit on a bedrock of data, mostly unused. There is strong ethical debate to be had about how we use this data, but in my opinion we need to act before our services crumble.
            Predictive analytical methods adopted from the field of data science could not only improve the efficiency of healthcare services, but could provide new insights into how we diagnose disease.
            Web technologies on the other hand, provide a powerful platform to make applications available to a wide range of services at scale.</p>
            <p class="lead">This is why I have pursued further education through online services, to adopt the necessary skills to develop tools and processes for the application of data science to laboratory medicine.
            You can read <strong><a class="text-primary js-scroll-trigger" href="#edu">below</a></strong> about this journey, and navigate the <strong><a class="text-primary js-scroll-trigger" href="#portfolio">portfolio</a></strong>
            section for examples of its application. I hope you enjoy, and please feel free to <strong><a class="text-primary js-scroll-trigger" href="#contact">contact me</a></strong>
            have you any further questions. I am always open to colaboration, offers, or conversation. Kind regards, Ross.</p>

              <p class="lead text-secondary">Starting with 'hacking' my favourite games or automating tedious tasks with macros, I've always been trying to get the most out of the technology around me. My first experience with what you could call true coding was during my Computer Science A-Level. My first
              programming language was VB6, and this was quickly followed by VB.net and SQL. I graduated top of my class in Computer Science and I was forever hooked on the power of programming.</p>

It was always going to be a choice between medical science or computer science, but I found a Biomedical Science degree which was fully funded and had gaurenteed post-graguate employment.</p>
                <p class="lead text-secondary">Thoughout my university degree, I kept up my programming skills, but I never took the time to expand on them, opting to instead focus on my skills and knowledge in Biomedical Science. I thought my programming interests would always come second to a career in the NHS...oh how wrong I was...</p>

It was here that the power of programming would return to me. Within a few months of being in my new grauduate job, I was applying my techie interests once again. I gained a leading role in the laboratory IT department, and since no-one else knew how to code,
                  I started writing VBA scripts, and SQL queries to extract data from the laboratory IT system. I eventually ended up building bispoke applications in VB.NET to handle larger repetitive tasks that required user input.</p>

I want to build data driven solutions for laboratory medicine, but in a modern NHS pathology laboratory, there just isn't the time or resources to do this. But the year was 2015, and online education was booming. So I started studying again. I left my full time position for contracting work, and have been on a crusade ever since to improve my technical skillset and apply it to the needs of pathology services.</p>

            <p class="lead">It was now obvious to me that I needed to take actions into my own hands, but like many newly graduated
            government employees, I couldn't afford to go back into full time education. So, I turned to our great friend, the internet.
            We live in the golden age of open education. If you want to learn something, there is a book, YouTube video, blog, or platform
            for you to learn from. My first hurdle was information overload. Where do you begin when there are so many programming languages, libraries, subjects and
            sub-categories? Luckily, I have some great friends who advised me, and after much swaying back and forth between ideas,
            I decided I was interested in two subject areas: Data Science, and Web Development. My focus is therefore: Python programming and machine learning, and HTML, CSS, and Javascript</p>
            <p class="lead">What I want to try and attempt to do now, is create a comprehensive guide of what resources I have used, and what
            resources I intend to use in the future. I will try and classify each resource with the difficulty level. It is my hope to keep expanding
            this list of resources in the future.</p>

              <p class="mb-2">Using 220,000 urine sample records provided by the medical microbiology laboratory at Severn Pathology in Bristol, UK
              I analysed the outcome of using automated urine microscopy to select samples for culture. The aim was to reduce laboratory workload
              without the risk of missing clinically significant cultures. Comprehensive analysis was conducted under the careful guide an experienced
              clinical and technical team to find the optimum microscopy thresholds that would generate the lowest possible false negative rate. I conducted
              my analysis of the dataset using the Pandas library in Python to provide insight into the outcomes of various thresholds. Expanding on this,
              application of machine learning was investigated as a means of predicting report outcomes before cultures are performed. Although not adopted,
              this novel approach gave great insight into the application of machine learning to medical microbiology, and is under consideration for future projects.</p>

              in some cases. To assist with the work of Dr Mustafa Hashim and his colleagues, I used a dataset of over 300 patients containing isolate
              information and postcode data. After exploring and cleaning the data in Python, I used the google maps API to geocode each unique isolate,
              and overlayed this data on a map of the local area using the the Bokeh.js library. I provided the medical team with an interactive
              display of the patient location, and the particular strain of NTM obtained through bacterial culture. The hope is to examine whether
              NTM strains cluster in particular locations.</p>
